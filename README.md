# Parking-Simulator
Hardware project programmed with Rust which aims to simulate a parking system, having a barrier controlled by a servo motor which receives commands from an IR remote and parking spots with movement sensor. 

I use two RP Pico, one RP Pico W and one RP Pico 2 W.

Built as part of my uni's Microprocessors' Architecture class
